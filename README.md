# Advanced-coding-for-data-analytics-23-24
Network graph-based bioinformatics project.

The dataset is available at: https://github.com/hetio/hetionet/tree/master/hetnet/tsv
(edges and nodes of the graph)

As an assignment, me and my teammate @chakir7769 were tasked with exploringthis graph and finding ways to suggest possible treatment through compounds of a given symptom in a patient. Of course as we don't have extended medical or biological know-how, this work aims at simply aiding a qualified professional in coming up with a treatment with minimized side-effects faster.

Other files constitute:
- code276661: jupyter noteook code file
- graph.zip : the zipped, already networkx-built graph (original file is quite big)
- betw.pickle : the pickled betweenness centralities, useful as computing them can take quite some time
